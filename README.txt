Dear, GDGoC reviewer

This project is part of the study case stage for the GDGoC. It demonstrates the following features:

1. Responsive Design, the website is designed to adapt with desktop and mobile devices.
2. Carousel Function, implemented to show a slideshow of images. This functionality is achieved using JavaScript.
3. Mobile Navigation Bar, the navigation bar is hidden to save space on mobile view. A toggle button is provided, allowing users to show or hide the navigation menu. This functionality is achieved using JavaScript.

Thank you for reviewing this project!
